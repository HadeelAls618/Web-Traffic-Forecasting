# Web Traffic Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project forecasts web traffic for the upcoming week using deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU). Accurate traffic predictions help businesses optimize marketing, manage server loads, and improve user engagement.

## Business Problem

For online businesses, understanding traffic patterns is essential to:

- **Optimize Marketing**: Schedule promotions and target ads when traffic is expected to peak.
- **Manage Server Capacity**: Prepare for traffic surges to avoid downtime and ensure smooth user experiences.
- **Enhance Engagement**: Improve user engagement by delivering targeted content at optimal times.

## Model Comparison

Three deep learning models were tested for this forecasting task:

1. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**  
   A basic RNN was implemented as a baseline model. RNNs handle sequential data well but struggle with long-term dependencies.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
   LSTMs are designed to capture longer-term dependencies, making them effective for time series data with seasonal trends. They typically outperform basic RNNs for complex sequences.

3. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**  
   GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs, often providing similar accuracy with fewer parameters, which can lead to faster training times.

Here's an updated **Results** section with a focus on why the RNN performed best, along with a **Future Directions** section that encourages experimentation with different models. I've made the future work suggestions a bit more creative, emphasizing ways to push the project forward.

## Results

After comparing model performance, the **RNN** was chosen as the best model for predicting web traffic patterns. Although more advanced models like LSTM and GRU are designed to capture complex, long-term dependencies, the relatively straightforward nature of this dataset allowed the RNN to perform well. RNNs have a simpler structure that can make them more efficient and less prone to overfitting on less complex datasets, and in this case, they generalized better to the validation data.

## Future Directions
1. **Experiment with Hybrid Models**: Try combining RNN layers with convolutional layers (e.g., CNN-RNN) to capture both short-term and long-term patterns in the data. This hybrid approach might reveal additional trends that a simple RNN alone may miss.

2. **Test Transformer Models**: While Transformers are more commonly used in natural language processing, they have been increasingly applied to time series forecasting. Experimenting with a Transformer-based model might improve the accuracy of long-term predictions, especially if more complex patterns are present in the data.

3. **Incorporate External Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources, like social media engagement or search trends, which could correlate with traffic spikes. Adding these external signals might make the model more robust and help it anticipate sudden changes in traffic.
