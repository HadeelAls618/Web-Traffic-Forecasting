# Web-Traffic-Forecasting
Got it! Hereâ€™s an updated README structure that includes a **Model Comparison** section where you can describe and compare the models you used, alongside a picture for visual reference. This version is still concise but lets you showcase your model evaluation and decision-making process effectively.

# Web Traffic Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project forecasts web traffic for the upcoming week using deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU). Accurate traffic predictions help businesses optimize marketing, manage server loads, and improve user engagement.

## Business Problem

For online businesses, understanding traffic patterns is essential to:

- **Optimize Marketing**: Schedule promotions and target ads when traffic is expected to peak.
- **Manage Server Capacity**: Prepare for traffic surges to avoid downtime and ensure smooth user experiences.
- **Enhance Engagement**: Improve user engagement by delivering targeted content at optimal times.

## Model Comparison

Three deep learning models were tested for this forecasting task:

1. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**  
   A basic RNN was implemented as a baseline model. RNNs handle sequential data well but struggle with long-term dependencies.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
   LSTMs are designed to capture longer-term dependencies, making them effective for time series data with seasonal trends. They typically outperform basic RNNs for complex sequences.

3. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**  
   GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs, often providing similar accuracy with fewer parameters, which can lead to faster training times.

## Results

After comparing model performance, the **[Best Model]** (e.g., LSTM) was chosen for its accuracy and efficiency in predicting web traffic patterns. Forecasts generated by this model provide valuable insights for business planning.
